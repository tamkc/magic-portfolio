## Overview

This project demonstrates how **Generative AI can be integrated into enterprise ERP systems** to enhance workflows while maintaining reliability, security, and auditability. Rather than treating AI as a black box, this implementation applies software engineering discipline to GenAI, ensuring that AI-powered features coexist with deterministic business logic.

## The Challenge

Enterprise Resource Planning systems like **Odoo** centralize critical business data—CRM interactions, accounting records, inventory flows, and internal communications. Traditional ERP workflows often involve:

- Manual data entry from unstructured documents
- Time-consuming review of lengthy quotations and contracts
- Complex reporting that requires domain expertise to interpret

The goal of this project is to **augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment**, making ERP workflows faster, smarter, and more accurate.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Document Summarization

- LLM-powered summarization for invoices, quotations, and email threads
- Extracts key information and generates concise summaries
- Preserves original documents for **audit compliance**

```python
# Prompt engineering for structured output
system_prompt = """
You are an ERP assistant analyzing business documents.
Extract and return JSON with:
- summary: 2-3 sentence overview
- key_amounts: list of monetary values
- action_items: required follow-ups
- risk_flags: potential issues to review
"""
```

### 2. AI-Assisted Data Entry

- Converts unstructured notes and emails into structured CRM fields
- AI suggests field values but requires human confirmation
- Reduces manual data entry while ensuring accuracy

### 3. Natural-Language Business Insights

Enabled stakeholders to query ERP data using plain language. Instead of writing complex SQL or navigating multiple reports, users can ask questions like:

- "What were our top 5 customers by revenue last quarter?"
- "Show me overdue invoices over $10,000"
- "Which products have declining sales trends?"

### 4. Anomaly Detection & Explanation

AI-powered detection of unusual patterns in accounting data with human-readable explanations. When the system flags an anomaly, it provides context about why it's unusual and suggests investigation steps.

## Architecture Principles

### Isolation

AI logic is **completely isolated** from core Odoo models. This separation ensures:
- ERP remains stable even when AI services experience issues
- AI components can be updated independently
- Clear boundaries for testing and debugging

### Validation

Every AI output is **validated before persistence**. The system uses Pydantic schemas to ensure generated data matches expected structures, with graceful fallbacks when validation fails.

### Fallback Paths

Every AI feature includes a **non-AI fallback**. If the LLM service is unavailable or returns invalid data, users can complete their tasks through traditional interfaces.

### Prompt Versioning

Prompts are treated as **engineering artifacts**, not hardcoded strings:
- Version controlled alongside application code
- Tested with representative input samples
- Monitored for output quality in production

## Technologies & Patterns

- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface supporting multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Token Management**: Context window optimization for cost-effective API usage
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with circuit breakers for API resilience
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging of AI calls for debugging and compliance

## Results

- **40% reduction** in document processing time
- **85% accuracy** on AI-suggested data entry (validated by human review)
- **Zero critical failures** from AI components affecting core ERP operations
- Positive user feedback on natural-language query capabilities

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with high-value, low-risk use cases**: Document summarization was ideal—helpful if correct, harmless if wrong
2. **Human-in-the-loop is essential**: AI suggestions require confirmation for business-critical data
3. **Invest in prompt engineering**: Well-crafted prompts with structured outputs dramatically improve reliability
4. **Plan for failure**: Every AI feature needs graceful degradation

## Future Roadmap

- **RAG Integration**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation using historical ERP data
- **Workflow Automation**: AI-triggered actions with human approval gates
- **Domain-Specific Tuning**: Fine-tuned models for industry-specific terminology
- **Explainable Outputs**: Enhanced audit trails showing AI reasoning

This project demonstrates that GenAI delivers the most value in enterprise systems when it is **reliable, controlled, and invisible to the end user**—enhancing productivity while maintaining the trust and compliance requirements of business-critical applications.
