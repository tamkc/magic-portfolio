## Overview

I led the development of a flexible, scalable frontend using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the React Context API. The project focused on transforming Figma designs into modular, reusable code, implementing state management via Context API, ensuring responsiveness, and optimizing the overall development workflow.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Developed a set of reusable UI components with React and Tailwind CSS in Next.js, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
- **Theming and Customization**: Utilized Tailwind CSS’s utility-first approach to allow effortless customization of colors, typography, and layouts based on Figma design specifications.
- **Figma Integration**: Integrated design tokens between Figma and code to ensure consistency, reducing discrepancies between design files and implementation.
- **State Management with Context API**: Utilized React’s Context API for global state management, enabling easy data flow and consistent state management across the app. This approach improved scalability and maintainability, especially as the project grew.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Created detailed documentation using Storybook, showcasing components, their usage, and best practices for other developers, making the adoption of the design system smooth and efficient.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Used for efficient global state management, simplifying the process of passing data across components and ensuring consistency in the app’s state.
- **React Context API**: Leveraged for building fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied for its highly customizable, utility-first CSS framework.
- **Shadcn/ui**: Used for building accessible and reusable UI components.
- **Storybook**: Utilized to document and demonstrate the component library interactively.

## Challenges and Learnings

One significant challenge was balancing the flexibility of the design system with the consistency of the implementation. By leveraging Tailwind’s configuration for design tokens, I ensured design specifications were clear and well-defined. Additionally, integrating the React Context API allowed for efficient global state management, reducing prop drilling and making the app more maintainable. Improving workflows between designers and developers, especially with Figma and Git, also led to a more seamless collaboration.

## Outcome

The result was faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, better management of global app state, and stronger collaboration between design and development teams. This project now serves as a robust and scalable foundation for delivering high-quality, cohesive user experiences across the platform.
