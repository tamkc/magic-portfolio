There's a moment every aspiring developer remembers—the day you land your first real job in tech. For me, that moment came in June 2021 when I started my internship at AT-Vibe Technology Limited. What I didn't expect was just how much fun I would have.

## The Project: A Queue Management System

My main project was developing a queue management and ticketing system for Manulife—yes, the actual system you see when you walk into their service centers. This wasn't a tutorial project or a classroom exercise. This was real software that real people would use every day.

The system included:

- **Customer-facing kiosk interface** for selecting services
- **Queue display screens** showing current ticket numbers
- **Counter control panels** for staff to manage queues
- **Thermal ticket printing** with hardware integration
- **Meeting room booking system** with calendar views

## Full Life Cycle Development

What made this internship special was experiencing the complete software development lifecycle. I wasn't just fixing bugs or writing documentation—I was building features from start to finish:

- **Frontend**: Building the user interfaces with responsive designs
- **Backend**: Writing the server logic and APIs
- **Database**: Designing schemas and writing queries
- **Hardware Integration**: Connecting to thermal printers and display screens

The thermal printer integration was particularly exciting. Seeing my code produce a physical ticket that a customer would hold in their hands—that was magical.

## The Fun of Building Real Things

There's something incredibly satisfying about building software that you can see working in the real world. Walking into a Manulife service center and seeing the queue display I helped build—that feeling is hard to describe.

The debugging sessions were intense. When a printer isn't responding or a display shows the wrong information, you can't just refresh the page and hope for the best. You have to understand the system end-to-end.

## What I Learned

### 1. Full-Stack Thinking

Working across the entire stack taught me how different layers of an application communicate. Understanding both frontend and backend made me a better developer in each area.

### 2. Hardware is Unpredictable

Software bugs are one thing. Hardware bugs are another level entirely. Printers jam, connections drop, displays freeze. Learning to write resilient code that handles these edge cases was invaluable.

### 3. User Experience Matters

When your software is used by real customers in a service center, every second of delay matters. I learned to think about performance and usability in a whole new way.

### 4. This is What I Want to Do

Most importantly, this internship confirmed that software development was my calling. The joy of solving problems, building features, and seeing them work in the real world—this is what I wanted to do for my career.

## Looking Back

This internship was more than just a first job. It was the foundation of everything that came after. The skills I learned, the confidence I gained, and the passion I discovered all started here.

To anyone starting their first internship: dive in deep. Ask questions. Build things. Make mistakes and learn from them. That first experience can shape your entire career.

I'm grateful AT-Vibe gave me the opportunity to work on something real. It was challenging, it was fun, and it changed everything.
