Every AI tool used to need its own custom integration for each data source. Slack required one connector, GitHub another, your database yet another. Model Context Protocol (MCP) changes this by providing a universal interface—like USB-C, but for AI.

## The Problem MCP Solves

AI models are powerful but isolated. They can't access your files, query your databases, or interact with your tools without custom integrations. Each new connection meant building and maintaining bespoke code.

MCP introduces a standardized protocol for bidirectional communication between AI applications and external systems. Build one MCP server, and any MCP-compatible AI can use it.

## How It Works

The architecture has three components:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `// MCP Server - exposes capabilities
const server = new MCPServer({
  name: 'my-database',
  capabilities: ['query', 'schema']
});

server.addTool('query', async ({ sql }) => {
  return await db.execute(sql);
});

// MCP Client - AI application connects
const client = new MCPClient();
await client.connect('my-database');
const result = await client.callTool('query', {
  sql: 'SELECT * FROM users'
});`,
            label: 'MCP Architecture',
            language: 'typescript'
        },
    ]}

- **MCP Servers**: Expose data and tools through the protocol
- **MCP Clients**: AI applications that connect to servers
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Data flows both ways securely

## Industry Adoption

MCP launched in November 2024 and adoption has been rapid:

- **March 2025**: OpenAI adopted MCP across ChatGPT
- **April 2025**: Google DeepMind confirmed Gemini support
- **December 2025**: Anthropic donated MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation

The ecosystem now includes over 13,000 MCP servers on GitHub. Claude's directory alone has 75+ connectors for services like GitHub, Slack, PostgreSQL, and Google Drive.

## Practical Use Cases

MCP enables AI agents to:

- Pull data from databases without exposing credentials to the model
- Execute code in sandboxed environments
- Access internal tools and APIs through a unified interface
- Collaborate with other agents on complex tasks

The Next.js 16 DevTools MCP integration is a good example—it gives AI agents access to your app's routing, logs, and errors for contextual debugging assistance.

## Security Considerations

With power comes responsibility. Security researchers have flagged concerns around prompt injection, tool permissions, and lookalike tools that could replace trusted ones. When implementing MCP:

- Audit which tools you expose
- Implement proper authentication
- Monitor tool usage patterns
- Keep servers updated

## Getting Started

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `# Install the MCP SDK
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

# Or use pre-built servers
npx @anthropic/mcp-server-github
npx @anthropic/mcp-server-postgres`,
            label: 'Terminal',
            language: 'bash'
        },
    ]}

Claude Desktop supports MCP out of the box for local testing. For production, remote server deployment is available for enterprise customers.

## Why This Matters

MCP represents a shift from siloed AI integrations to a connected ecosystem. Instead of every AI vendor building custom connectors, we get a shared standard that benefits everyone.

The donation to the Linux Foundation signals this isn't just an Anthropic project anymore—it's becoming infrastructure. As AI agents become more capable, having a standardized way to give them access to tools and data becomes essential.
